* spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/jpa_demo
    means:
    jdbc:postgresql:// → Tells Java to use the PostgreSQL JDBC driver
    localhost → Database is running on your local machine
    5432 → Default port PostgreSQL listens on
    /jpa_demo → Name of the database you want to connect to
    make sure you’ve already created a database in PostgreSQL named jpa_demo.

* public interface StudentRepo extends JpaRepository<Student, Integer>{...}
    Here JpaRepository<Student, Integer> is the type of object that we'll be working with and in this object our primary key will be the RollNo,
    and the type of RollNo is integer so in the 2nd param type of primary key is passed.

* Add "@Entity" annotation in the Student model class so that this class should be persisted(objects of this class (Student) to be saved into, 
  retrieved from, updated, and deleted from a database table.) in the database.

* Since this class is now persisted in DB, next step is to assign "Primary key" that is done by using "@Id" annotation. E.g. :
    @Entity
    public class Student {
	@Id
	private int rollNo;........}
